# Blockchain Blockchain Blockchain

This week is all about [YFI Farming](https://defirate.com/yfi-governance-token/) after [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance) yield aggregator
released the [YFI governance token](https://gov.yearn.finance/).  It can only currently be earned by [contributing to one of the yearn liquidity pools](https://medium.com/iearn/earning-yfi-y-curve-fi-53b5fd347f0f).
This caused LTV in thos pools to shoot up, YFI price rocketing to \>\$1000 and giving APYof \>1000% in the pools for early liquidity providers (I managed a 5% return over a day).
