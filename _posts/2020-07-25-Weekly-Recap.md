# Blockchain Blockchain Blockchain

This week is all about [YFI Farming](https://defirate.com/yfi-governance-token/) after [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance) yield aggregator
released the [YFI governance token](https://gov.yearn.finance/).  It can only currently be earned by [contributing to one of the yearn liquidity pools](https://medium.com/iearn/earning-yfi-y-curve-fi-53b5fd347f0f).
This caused LTV in thos pools to shoot up, YFI price rocketing to \>\$1000 and giving APYof \>1000% in the pools for early liquidity providers (I managed a 5% return over a day).

[A Credit Union called Union](https://medium.com/primeradiant/a-credit-union-called-union-521358a995cc) - under-collateralized loans in DeFi [union.finance](https://union.finance/).  Also by same author [MetaMoneyMarket](https://medium.com/primeradiant/introducing-metamoneymarket-62b23969c7ea) protocol for optimising yield.  This is from August 2019 so would be interesting to compare to the yearn ecosystem.

[How to revolutionise AI and become famous](https://twitter.com/rodneyabrooks/status/1204249201913122817) "Perhaps there is an opportunity to reinvent evolutionary computation and exploit the competition ready training sets and massive amounts of computation. This will need innovations at the "genetic" level, but we have learned an awful lot in the last 30 years about mechansims in real genetics that we did not know existed--e.g. self repair, gene regulation, epigenesis, non-genetic inheritance, etc. Of course, like current DL and DRL perhaps an engineering answer does not need to include much similarity with biological systems."

And as I have tried to make clear with years of articles and talks, the empowered product team model is a fundamentally different approach to building and running a tech-product organization.”
