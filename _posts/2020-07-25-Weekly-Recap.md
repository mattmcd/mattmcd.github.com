This week I started rereading [Red Plenty](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Plenty-Francis-Spufford-ebook/dp/B0044DEFSC) by Francis Spufford, linear programming and economics in the USSR.  It inspired me enough to get [Mechanism Design: A Linear Programming Approach](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00H7WPE00) by Rakesh V. Vohra to see if there's anything I can apply to work.  Linear programming is fun, been a while since I've played with it.

This week is all about [YFI Farming](https://defirate.com/yfi-governance-token/) after [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance) yield aggregator
released the [YFI governance token](https://gov.yearn.finance/).  It can only currently be earned by [contributing to one of the yearn liquidity pools](https://medium.com/iearn/earning-yfi-y-curve-fi-53b5fd347f0f).
This caused LTV in those [pools to shoot up](https://defipulse.com/yearn.finance), YFI price rocketing to \>\$1000 and giving APY of \>1000% in the pools for early liquidity providers.

[A Credit Union called Union](https://medium.com/primeradiant/a-credit-union-called-union-521358a995cc) - under-collateralized loans in DeFi [union.finance](https://union.finance/).  Also by same author [MetaMoneyMarket](https://medium.com/primeradiant/introducing-metamoneymarket-62b23969c7ea) protocol for optimising yield.  This is from August 2019 so would be interesting to compare to the yearn ecosystem.

[How to revolutionise AI and become famous](https://twitter.com/rodneyabrooks/status/1204249201913122817) "Perhaps there is an opportunity to reinvent evolutionary computation and exploit the competition ready training sets and massive amounts of computation. This will need innovations at the "genetic" level, but we have learned an awful lot in the last 30 years about mechansims in real genetics that we did not know existed--e.g. self repair, gene regulation, epigenesis, non-genetic inheritance, etc. Of course, like current DL and DRL perhaps an engineering answer does not need to include much similarity with biological systems."
